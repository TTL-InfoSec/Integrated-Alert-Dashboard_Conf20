This contains all the unique commands we used across all indexes and does not form a recommended starting point. Please read the comments and pick the lines needed for your usecase. 
These should be saved as alerts with the alert action "output results to lookup" with append selected

| eval alert_title="PA_Test".                                #Set your alert name here
| eval kill_chain="other".                                   #Set your kill_chain here
| eval alert_severity=severity                               #Set your alert severity here
| eval date = strftime(_time, "%Y-%m-%d")                    #This line creates a field called date
| rename dest_hostname as dest_domain, user as username      #This field helps standardize the context to ensure we use the same field names in each index
| lookup dhcp.csv src OUTPUT hostname                        #This uses the enrichment file that holds IPs/Hostnames. It matches fields that have the src and outputs the associated hostname. You need to add date here for historical data
| eval hostname=mvindex(hostname,0)                          #This modifies hostname to only store the latest entry in the dhcp csv
| eval src=if(isnull(src),placehold,src)                     #This will fill in any any field that is null with the value stored in placehold otherwise it will stay the current stored value
| lookup hostname_username.csv hostname output username      #This uses the enrichment file that pairs hostname and usernames to add usernames to matching fields based on the hostname
| fillnull value=unknown                                     #This will fill in any null(empty) fields with the string unknown. This just helps clean up the tables in the dashboard
| eval dest_domain=if(isnull(dest_domain),"?","unknown")     #This can be used to create a field that may not exist in all logs in an index, but exists in some. It will set those who do not have the field to have it with unknown
| table  _time, alert_title, kill_chain, alert_severity      #These fields will be the fields in the alert CSV. Ensure this matches for all alerts in an index
